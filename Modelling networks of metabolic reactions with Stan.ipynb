    "# Modelling networks of metabolic reactions with Stan\n",
    "\n",
    "Many useful substances can be produced using chemical reactions that happen inside living organisms like _E. Coli,_ yeast or Chinese hamster ovaries. Biological production is appealing because it can be done in relatively mild conditions. On the other hand, biological production depends on complex networks of interacting enzyme-catalysed chemical reactions which can be difficult to understand, manipulate and optimise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes how to analyse metabolic networks by integrating different sources of information - structural knowledge, pre-experimental information about parameters and experiment results - using Bayesian inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wait, what is an enzyme-catalysed reaction?\n",
    "An enzyme is a 'catalyst' protein that speeds up a chemical reaction by binding the reactants to an 'active site' where the conditions for the reaction are favourable. This visualisation gives an idea of how this process is thought to work: \n",

    "\n",
    "## Structural information \n",
    "\n",
    "The topological structure of most industrially relevant metabolic networks has been mapped. It is usually known which substances go in and out of each reaction the enzyme that catalyses it. Often there is even more structural information, such as what shape the enzyme has, which substances can bind to its active site.\n",
    "\n",
    "This information is available online, for example in the [BIGG database](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a reduced map of yeast central metabolism, with nodes representing metabolites and edges representing reactions: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/yeast_central_metabolism.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finer-grained structural information can be used to deduce the mechanism by which each enzyme operates. A mechanism, in turn, implies a way of parameterising the rate at which an enzyme turns substrates into products. For example, the following equation describes how the rate $v$ of a 'uni-uni' mechanism (See [Cleland (1963)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0926-6569%2863%2990211-6) for more about mechanisms in general and derivations of particular mechanisms used in this analysis) with no activators or inhibitors depends on the current concentration of its substrate $A$ and product $P$, as well as parameters $K_{eq}$, $K_{a}$, $V1$ and $V2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "v = \\frac{V1\\cdot{V2}\\cdot{(A-P/K_{eq})}}{K_{a}\\cdot{V2} + V2\\cdot{A} + V1\\cdot{P/K_{eq}}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The main output of this analysis will be inference about the values of this kind of parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-experimental information\n",
    "Most parameters are difficult to assess because the conditions inside a cell are difficult to replicate _in vitro_. See [Saa and Keld Nielsen (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2017.09.005) for more about top-down vs bottom-up parameter estimation. Nonetheless, a lot of information is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "For kinetic parameters it is possible to use the 'Respectful' modelling paradigm (see [Tsigkinopoulou, Baker, and Breitling (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2016.12.008)) to aggregate the results of findings about kinetic parameters published in the [BRENDA enzyme database](https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/), as well as assessments of thermodynamic parameters from the [equilibrator database](http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/). This analysis produces an independent normal or log-normal distribution representing the pre-experimental information available about each parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimental information\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern experimental techniques measure the following quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enzyme concentrations (_proteomics_)\n",
    "- Metabolite concentrations (_metabolomics_)\n",
    "- Rates of reactions, aka fluxes (_fluxomics_)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each kind of measurement is noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modelling strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "We are proposing to use Bayesian inference to combine all the available sources of information about a metabolic network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-experimental information supplies informative prior probability distributions about the parameters that describe each reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We treat information from metabolomics and fluxomics data using a regression model where recorded values of measured quantities are draws from distributions centered on the true values as follows, with indexes $e$ standing for experiments, $f$ for fluxes and $m$ for metabolites:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "measured\\, flux_{f,e} \\sim Normal(true\\, flux_{f,e}, \\sigma_{f,e}) \\\\\n",
    "measured\\, metabolite\\, concentration_{m,e} \\sim Lognormal(\\log(true\\, metabolite\\, concentration_{m,e}), \\sigma_{m,e})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural information can be used to connect the other two sources of information by mapping parameter configurations to true metabolite concentrations and fluxes. This is done by expressing the evolution of each metabolite's concentration as a system of ordinary differential equations, with the rate of change of each metabolite determined by the rates of the reactions that produce and consume it. We assume that, at the time of measurement, the concentration of the network's internal metabolites is constant, or in other words that the system has reached a steady state. In general, a vector $\\mathbf{v}$ of steady state fluxes must satisfy the following condition\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S\\cdot\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $S$ is a known 'stoichiometric matrix' indicating which reactions produce and consume which metabolites and $\\mathbf{0}$ is a vector of as many zeros as the network has internal metabolites. Given a parameter configuration, a steady state metabolite concentration can be found by solving the resulting system of algebraic equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We solve these equation systems by integrating the implied ODEs over a period of time for which it is safe to assume that the system has reached steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is essentially the same as that set out by [Saa and Keld Nielsen (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep29635), but uses MCMC via Stan rather than rejection sampling to make inferences. Thanks to Stan's intuitive model language, this approach and attendant assumptions can be represented in a more or less self-documenting form.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example - a simple linear system\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the notebook applies this modelling strategy to investigate how accurately it is possible to find out the value of the kinetic parameters and steady state metabolite concentrations of the simple metabolic network depicted below, given a known experimental setup and prior information.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/linear.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This network has two internal metabolites, M1 and M2, and three reactions R1, R2 and R3. Metabolites M1 and M2 are measured, and reaction R2 is inhibited by M1. The test tube photos indicate quantities that were measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gauge how accurately the available information identifies the quantities of interest, the notebook uses Stan to generate simulated experimental data given 'true' parameter values, then uses the simulated data as model input. If the model is unable to recover the true value of a parameter, this is may be a sign that the simulated experiment shouldn't be carried out in real life without more diverse or accurate measurements or better pre-experimental information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model input\n",
    "We are developing an input data format for succinctly expressing the information required to model a metabolic network. Here is what the linear system looks like in this format:"

    "From the summary and lack of warnings from the diagnostic function we can see that the chains have mixed pretty well and that there were no post-warmup divergent transitions. From the summary of the `metabolite_flux` variables shows that these were mostly very close to zero, indicating that the system reached steady state in most iterations.\n",

    "In order to ascertain whether the simulated experimental apparatus is powerful enough for it to learn about the network's parameters, we can look at each parameter's marginal prior and posterior distribution. If the model has learned about the parameter then there should be more probability mass around the true value in the marginal posterior distribution than in the prior.\n",

    "For some parameters we can see that the marginal posterior concentrates more closely around the true value than the marginal prior distribution. For other parameters this is not the case. Depending on which parameters we care most about, this test could help determine whether or not to carry out the experiments."

     "abstract": "Kinetic models are critical to predict the dynamic behaviour of metabolic networks. Mechanistic kinetic models for large networks remain uncommon due to the diﬃculty of ﬁtting their parameters. Recent modelling frameworks promise new ways to overcome this obstacle while retaining predictive capabilities. In this review, we present an overview of the relevant mathematical frameworks for kinetic formulation, construction and analysis. Starting with kinetic formalisms, we next review statistical methods for parameter inference, as well as recent computational frameworks applied to the construction and analysis of kinetic models. Finally, we discuss opportunities and limitations hindering the development of larger kinetic reconstructions.",

A shorthand notation for writing down such mechanisms is also described. A general method for expressing the full steady-state rate equations for these mechanisms in terms of measurable kinetic constants is explained, and the resulting rate equations are given for a number of mechanisms with two or three substrates or products. The manner in which kinetic studies can be used to determine enzymic mechanisms is discussed, and examples are given to illustrate the types of information about reaction mechanisms that can be obtained.",
